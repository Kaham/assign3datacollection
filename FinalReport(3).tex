\section{FINDINGS}
{   According to the people i interacted with around the college of computing of computing and information sciences, I found out many students have been victims of circumstances of campus violence. Most of the cases I recorded were theft most especially in halls of residence for resident students and the other issue was stalking most especially for the freshers. Furthermore I found out that this brings about emotional or psychological injury and greatly affects their academics standards and a barrier to their careers.According to the the results I obtained, most of 10 people of every 30 people you ask have ever faced campus violence in one	way or another.Also most of the students who are victims are introverts in that they don't express their concerns to the authorities giving a reason that they don't expect any help from the authorities in order to get justice.The following table summarizes some information I managed to collect about campus violence around Makerere university.
	
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ |X|X|X| }
	\hline
	Type of violence & Victims for every 10 people & Percentage  \\
	\hline 
	Theft  & 8  & 80    \\
	\hline
	Stalking & 5 & 50   \\
	\hline
	Sexual Assault &  4 & 40  \\
	\hline
	Hazing & 3 & 30  \\
	\hline
\end{tabularx}

\section{CONCLUSIONS}
{I think it is extremely important to have protocols in place for conveying information regarding dangerous situations and threats,search and seizure, culprits so that they can face the law and bring justice to victims. A strong emphasis must be placed on increasing staff and student awareness of policies and procedures to curb the vice.
}
\section{RECOMMENDATIONS}
{Encouraging students/staff to report verbal and written threats, weapons, and bizarre behaviors.\\
	Implementing tougher sanctions, including expulsion/suspension for serious misconduct.\\
	Creating zero tolerance policies for campus violence.
