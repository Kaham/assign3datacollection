\section{INTRODUCTION}
{The principal objective of this study is to examine the issue of campus violence inside the great gates of Makerere 
	University.Violence can be defined as the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm and maldevelopment. Makerere university is porous and vulnerable to various types of threats for instance stalking,domestic violence,sexual violence and assault and other activities conducted by disgruntled students or employees from both internal and external sources.I truly believe that for a campus community to be truly healthy, it must be guided by the values of multicultural inclusion, respect, and equality. Intolerance has no place at an institution of higher learning.}
\section{BACKGROUND TO THE PROBLEM}
{The country's oldest university has witnessed incidents of campus violence including suicide, sexual violence and sexual assault, thefts and robberies ranging from removal of car parts from car parks, computers or computer accessories, phones, cameras, laptops to studentsâ€™ property from halls of residence.Other incidents include cyber crimes including sending of threatening anonymous text messages or emails, or sending pornographic pictures on phones or social networks. On the issue of sexual violence in particular, based on the 2004 findings on Situational Analysis of Gender Terrain at Makerere University, conducted by the Gender Mainstreaming Division,a Sexual Harassment Prevention Policy was established. In line with the constitution of the Republic of Uganda that guarantees all Ugandans equality, dignity and non-discrimination,the University pledged to commit to respect the rights of all the students and academic staff. And this is still on-going with the potential to track success over time.
